Introduction

Education is an most important wealth in the society. With the corona-virus outbreak that has disrupted life around the globe in 2020, the educational systems have been affected in many ways; studies show that student’s performance has decreased since then, which highlights the need to deal with this problem more seriously and try to find effective solutions, as well as the influencing factors.

Motivation

The educational systems need, at this specific time, innovative ways to improve quality of education to achieve the best results and decrease the failure rate.As students of the IT department who studied in the last month a little about machine learning, we know that in order for an institute to provide quality education to learners, deep analysis of previous records of the learners can play a vital role, and wanted to work on this challenging task.

Objectives 

Here, we will:

•	Predict whether or not a student will pass the final exam based on certain information given

•	Compare the three learning algorithms

•	Find out what most affects student achievement

•	Find the best algorithm with high accuracy

We will be using three learning algorithms:

•	Logistic regression

•	Supported vector machine

•	KNN

Dataset:

Dataset name: Student.csv 

Source: Kaggle

INFERENCE:

•	Here we have used three models such as logistic regression, KNN and SVM to check the performance of those models and identify which model performs well with better accuracy.

•	The models are hyper tuned to increase their accuracy.

•	From this it is identified that SVM provides greater accuracy compared to all other models.

•	In SVM we identified the accuracy of three different kernels such as linear, polynomial and gaussian kernel among the three the linear kernel of SVM provides greater accuracy of 84%.
